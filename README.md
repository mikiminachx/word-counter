## Word Counter
![Screenshot of Word Counter](/doc/demo.png)
The Word Counter is written in ReactJS, HTML and CSS. Since the GitHub workflow is troublesome, I have decided not to deploy it on GitHub Page.
### Launching the website
#### Step 1: Clone this repository to the local.
```
gh repo clone mikiminachx/word-counter
```
#### Step 2: Download Node.JS (Optional)
You can download Node.JS directly from [its website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
#### Step 3: Run Node.JS to initial the website
Run the following command in the terminal:
```
cd word-counter
npm i
npm run predeploy
npm start
```
